Dockerfile for running [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org) in a Docker container.

* Base image: `debian:jessie`
* Exposed ports: None
* Volumes: None

### Usage
You should generally run the container with host networking. Something like:
```
docker run -d --net host --name freeswitch praekeltfoundation/freeswitch
```

If you want to use FreeSWITCH's CLI, you can use Docker's `exec` command to connect to the running container:
```
docker exec -it freeswitch fs_cli
```

### Packages
This is NOT a complete FreeSWITCH installation - the Docker image only contains the "meta-vanilla" packages as well as a couple of extra modules. FreeSWITCH is a very large software project with many submodules. We install only the features that *we* need. Still, this may be a useful starting point for anybody looking to run FreeSWITCH under Docker.

We install the following FreeSWITCH packages:
* `freeswitch-conf-vanilla`
* `freeswitch-meta-vanilla`
* `freeswitch-mod-flite` (for text-to-speech)
* `freeswitch-mod-shout` (for playing audio from files)
* `freeswitch-sounds-en-us-callie` (some basic audio clips we use - **note that these add significantly to the image size**)

### Networking
It is not recommended that you use Docker's bridge networking mode for FreeSWITCH as some of the protocols (namely, SIP) make use of a very large number of ports and it is not feasible to forward all of these ports to the host. Instead, consider using Docker's host networking mode or a network type that gives the container its own IP address.

We disable IPv6 networking for Sofia and the Event Socket as there seem to be problems in some recent versions of FreeSWITCH with platforms that don't support IPv6 (e.g. inside a Docker container with bridge networking with the default Docker daemon settings).

### Configuration
For the most part we use the default "vanilla" configuration that FreeSWITCH installs in `/usr/share/freeswitch/conf/vanilla`. However, we do override some of the configuration options. The changes are as follows:
* `autoload_configs/console.conf.xml`:
  * Disable console colorizing as this seems to break some logging systems.
* `autoload_configs/event_socket.conf.xml`:
  * Bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `::` to disable IPv6 (which has issues as described above).
* `autoload_configs/modules.conf.xml`:
  * Disable `mod_logfile` as the container logs are consumed from stdout/stderr, not a file.
  * Enable `mod_h26x` for H.263/4 CODEC support.
  * Enable `mod_flite`.
  * Enable `mod_shout`.
* `directory/default/example.com.xml`:
  * This file is renamed to prevent FreeSWITCH from setting up an example (and non-functional) SIP gateway.
* `sip_profiles/{external,internal}-ipv6.xml`:
  * These files are renamed to disable IPv6 SIP profiles.
